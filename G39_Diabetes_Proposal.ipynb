    "Our project investigates potential key factors associated with diabetes mellitus in females of Pima Indian decent aged 21 and above. Diabetes mellitus is a serious disease affecting many populations causing severe health complications such as heart failure, with the main associated cause of death being coronary heart disease (Das, 2014). Those of Indian decent often have higher rates of diabetes suggesting a potential genetic predisposition to insulin resistance, however many other factors can play a role in the presence of diabetes. There are many known risk factors associated with this disorder, some of which include parental diabetes, obesity, and genetic components (Das, 2014). High rates of diabetes mellitus is not only a severe health issue, but it also places a significant strain on the healthcare system (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2022). Throughout our project we aim to answer the question of whether the 5 factors we have selected can accurately predict the onset of diabetes within a five year time frame with a high degree of over 75%. The original data set consisted of 9 different attributes, however we have chosen to narrow our scope to focus on the five factors most associated with potential modifiable or reversible qualities. The observations we will be examining throughout our project include plasma glucose concentration level at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test (ie. glucose test, mg/dl), diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), triceps skin fold thickness (a measure of body fat (mm)), hour serum insulin (µU/mL), and body mass index (kg/m^2). The data set we have chosen is titled “Diabetes Dataset” created from the findings of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases which was uploaded by Mehmet Akturk found on Kaggle."
